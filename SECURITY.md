# Security Policy

We take the security of our users' data seriously. We encourage you to report any actual or potential security vulnerabilities you discover. 

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please **do not** report security vulnerabilities through public channels like GitHub issues. 

Instead, contact the maintainer at: `noppanut.connect@gmail.com`

We will acknowledge your report as soon as possible and work towards a resolution.

## Responsible Disclosure

We encourage responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. This means privately reporting a vulnerability to us before it is publicly known. This allows us to address the issue before it can be exploited.

## Disclaimer

This project is maintained on a volunteer basis. We will do our best to address reported vulnerabilities in a timely manner, but there may be instances where response times may vary.
