Thank you for requesting support for your dive computer! This will help make depthviz compatible with a wider range of devices.

**Please provide the following information:**

*   **Dive Computer Brand:** (e.g., Suunto, Shearwater, Garmin)
*   **Dive Computer Model:** (e.g., D4i Novo, Terric, Descent Mk2i)
*   **A Sample CSV File:** Please attach a *small* sample CSV file exported from your dive computer. Ideally, this should contain at least one complete dive. **Please remove any personally identifiable information (PII) like serial numbers, dive site names (unless you are comfortable sharing), or other sensitive data.** You can replace specific values with placeholder data. (e.g., replace actual depths with generic depths)
*   **Export Source:** Where are you exporting the CSV file from? (e.g., Desktop software, Web platform)
*   **Relevant Documentation (if available):** If you have any documentation or specifications from the manufacturer, please provide a link or attach the document.

**Example of a good submission:**

*   **Dive Computer Brand:** Shearwater
*   **Dive Computer Model:** Teric
*   **A Sample CSV File:** [Attached: `shearwater_teric_sample_dive.csv`]
*   **Export Source:** Shearwater Cloud Desktop (https://shearwater.com/pages/shearwater-cloud)
*   **Relevant Documentation:** [Link to Shearwater's documentation (if available)]

**Why we need this information:**

The CSV export formats vary significantly between different dive computer manufacturers. Providing a sample CSV file is essential for us to understand the format and implement the necessary parsing logic in `depthviz`.

**What happens after you submit this issue:**

*   We will review your request and the provided CSV file.
*   We may ask you for further clarification or additional samples if needed.
*   We will prioritize support for different dive computers based on demand and complexity.
*   Once support is implemented, we will notify you in this issue and include it in a future release of `depthviz`.

Thank you for your contribution to improving `depthviz`!
